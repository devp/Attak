Attak is a Tak client for the existing playtak servers, written in godot.
It brings new features such as a 2D board and a mobile-friendly interface,
It is available on:
- desktop (Windows / Linux)
- android
- the web: [attak.club](attak.club)

## Installation
the latest version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/The1Rogue/Attak/releases/latest)

#### Android:
download `Attak.apk` to you mobile device, and run to install the app.

#### Windows:
download `Attak_Win.zip` to your device, unzip to reveal 2 files (`Attak.pck`, `Attak.exe`)
make sure both files are in the same directory, then run `Attak.exe`

#### Linux:
download `Attak.x86_64`, and run it.

#### Web:
simply go to [attak.club](attak.club)

if you wish to host attak yourself, download `Attak_Web.zip`, unzip, and serve `Attak.html`,
do note that some functionality may be limited if your domain does not have access to the playtak api

## Building

`tools/build-apk.sh` produces a signed Android APK headlessly; see the comments at
the top of the script for the toolchain it expects. `.github/workflows/android.yml`
runs the same script in CI and uploads the APKs as artifacts.

The Syntaks extension is MIT licensed and places no conditions on Attak's own
licensing — see [LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md](LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md), which also
explains why it depends on a fork. Build with `SKIP_SYNTAKS=1` for an APK with no
native engine at all.
